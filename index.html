          <div class="biocard__content">
            <p>I am a commercial real estate professional with extensive experience in development, management and consulting both as an employee and owner. My original focus was in large master planned community development which included development of two golf course communities. After the great recession, my focus changed initially to troubled asset workouts then into commercial property management.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am the Director of Advisory Services and Technology for my current company and have been managing the development of our investor portal. As a result, I have rekindled a long standing interest in programming. To act on that interest, I am currently enrolled in MIT's xPro <em>Full Stack Development with MERN</em> coding bootcamp.</p>

          <h2 class="biocardName">Cont'd</h2>
          <div class="biocard__content">
            <p>My initial goal is to be able to improve my management of our software developer through a deeper understanding of the process and technologies. Additionally, I intend to be hands-on in the development and maintenance of the code as I progress through the bootcamp.</p>
